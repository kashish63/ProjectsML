Projects in Machine Learning from Beginner to Advanced.

**Project 1. Rock vs Mine Prediction:**

A system coded in Python that can predict whether an object is either Rock or Mine with SONAR data. In this use case, we are utilising a logistic regression model for our prediction.


**Project 2. Diabetes Prediction**

A project can predictÂ a woman's diabetes status using machine learning. This project makes use of Python. In this study, we use a support vector machine model for the prediction.
A prediction method can detect whether a woman is diabetic or not based on dataset features including pregnancies, glucose, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin, BMI, diabetes pedigree, and age.

**Project 3. Fake News Prediction**

A project on predicting fake news using machine learning and Python. This project uses a dataset with features like id, title, author, and text to predict if a news is fake or real.
We will be using Logistic Regression model for prediction
